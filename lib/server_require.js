  // Well, we have a problem: our clients use requirejs which use a regexp to
  // find users of require() before running code so that folks can write
  // synchronous-looking code (e.g. var a = require('a')) even though loading
  // the code takes time, but our modules sometimes need to include server-only
  // dependencies (like server/util/googleapis). One approach is to move all
  // such deps to lib/, and require that all implementers provide SOME version
  // that works in both client and server, but I suspect that this is a high
  // burden. Instead, when you need to include a server-only dep, use this
  // library:
  //
  // var serverRequire = require('lib/server_require');
  // ...
  // class ServerOnlyCode extends ModuleInterface.Server {
  //   willBeShownSoon() {
  //     var serverOnlyDep = serverRequire('server/dep');
  //   }
  // }
